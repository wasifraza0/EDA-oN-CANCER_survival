# EDA-oN-CANCER_survival
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis of the Haberman's Survival dataset. The dataset contains information on patients who underwent surgery for breast cancer and includes the patient's age, year of operation, and number of positive axillary nodes. The goal of this analysis is to understand the relationship between these variables and the patient's survival status, which is recorded as either "survived" or "died."

The repository contains the following files:

haberman.csv: The original Haberman's Survival dataset in csv format
haberman.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the exploratory data analysis
README.md: this file
The Jupyter notebook covers the following topics:

Data preparation and cleaning
Data visualization
Univariate and bivariate analysis
Conclusion and further research
The notebook makes use of the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
To run the notebook, you will need to have Jupyter installed on your machine. Once you have Jupyter installed, you can clone this repository, navigate to the directory in the command line and type jupyter notebook. This will open Jupyter in your browser, and you can then open the haberman.ipynb notebook and run the code.

This analysis provides a starting point for understanding the relationship between patient characteristics and survival status in the Haberman's Survival dataset. Further research and analysis could include additional data cleaning and transformation, more in-depth statistical analysis, and incorporating other variables that may be relevant to patient survival.
